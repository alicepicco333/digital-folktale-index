    <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
    <!-- <p> -->This paper argues for a digital folkloristics that combines the textual/quantitative approaches characteristic of the digital humanities (DH) with the field-based methods composing digital ethnography. It also outlines a broad category of digitally-enabled and digitally-focused scholarly work that is inclusive and in dialogue with many disciplines and acknowledges both the textual and ethnographic dimensions of folkloristic work. KEYWORDS: digital scholarship; digital ethnography; digital humanities; digital methodology; interdisciplinarity</p>

        Digital scholarship—henceforth DS, because this is the age of acronyms is notoriously nebulous. The term may ultimately be an unnecessary repackaging of work scholars in all disciplines have been doing all along, activities which are imagined as somehow different in the digital age despite no one being able to identify any really substantive differences besides the new technologies themselves (cf. <span class='person' id=''>Weller</span> 2011:3, 14–28). Regardless of its connotations, DS is unquestionably now a thing, attested to by the existence of digital scholarship centers and programs in many colleges and universities, and the large and growing body of literature that aligns itself with one or another digital approach; and as a thing it demands attention. For folklorists the category of digital scholarship is especially significant, representing a significant opportunity both for combining disparate approaches within the discipline, and for engaging in meaningful ways with scholarship in other fields. Unfortunately, although folklorists have produced a considerable amount of work that can be broadly termed digital, they have seldom availed themselves of these opportunities. This paper argues that a digital approach to folkloristics needs to be as methodologically and theoretically open as possible, respecting disciplinary traditions while also engaging with the considerable volume of digital scholarship that our colleagues in other fields have already undertaken. In exploring existing forms of digital scholarship and attempting to locate digital folkloristics within DS it outlines a broad category of digitally enabled and digitally focused scholarly work that is inclusive of folkloristics’ own diversity of approaches and simultaneously in dialogue with allied disciplines. This is no call for folklorists to attend to the digital: such calls have been made, repeatedly, over the last two decades and more (e.g., <span class='person' id=''>Kirshenblatt</span>-<span class="person">Gimblett</span> 1996; <span class='person' id=''>Blank</span> 2009, 2012). Neither is this a comprehensive bibliography of digital scholarship literature. Rather, our aim is to broadly trace the contours of emerging (and in some cases, well-established) discourses surrounding digital scholarship in allied disciplines. In so doing we hope also to highlight the differential invocations of “the digital,” both inside and outside of folkloristics, which may refer on the one hand to computational approaches and on the other to qualitative studies of “the digital” in the abstract. Inside the discipline, the invocation of digital folkloristics as a shorthand for computer-assisted analysis of folkloric texts or even conventional close readings of texts which happen tooriginate and/or circulate in digital contexts risks obscuringthe ethnographic dimension of much contemporary folkloristic research on digital aspects of vernacular life. The emerging subfield of digital folkloristics needs to make explicit conceptual and methodological space for both textually-focused studyand digital ethnography, a set of methodologies that, like “conventional” ethnography, seek to understand (digital) culturesholistically, not as a collection of discrete texts but as a networkof interrelationships between texts, contexts, groups, identities,and social processes.Neither is this an attempt to narrow the (sub)field of digitalfolkloristics or to police its boundaries. Instead we aim to callattention to the different approaches already included withincontemporary digital scholarship as a whole and point out areasof convergence between extra disciplinary DS and the work ofcontemporary folklorists. The goal is to ensure that digital folkloristics, if it does in fact coalesce into a sub-field or methodology—and we suggest it can and, for now at least, should be understood to include more than one type of digital work. Far fromnarrowing the field, a digital folkloristics that honors the discipline’s own diverse methodological and theoretical concerns andremains conversant with allied disciplines will have the effect ofopening new areas for folkloristic exploration and collaboration.Forms of digital scholarship and their implications forfolkloristics. A 2006 report commissioned by the American Council ofLearned Societies offers the following framework for understanding digital scholarship:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Building a digital collection of information for further study and analysis</li>
        <li>Creating appropriate tools for collection-building</li>
        <li>Creating appropriate tools for the analysis and study of collections</li>
        <li>Using digital collections and analytical tools to generate new intellectual products</li>
        <li>Creating authoring tools for these new intellectual products, either in traditional forms or in digital form. (<span class='person' id=''>Courant</span> et al. 2006:7)</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- <p> -->
        The authors of the report specify letter D as the “core meaning and ultimate objective of ‘digital scholarship’” (7), though they emphasize that collection and tool building, as opposed to tool use, are also important.1 Much has happened, of course, in the years since the ACLS report was released. But its emphasis on tools and collections suggest a corpus focused, analytical orientation that does not necessarily reflect the concerns or methodologies of all disciplines, nor exhaust the possibilities of digital scholarship. By emphasizing corpuses and tool building as the “core” of DS, this model inadvertently excludes other digital possibilities. <span class='person' id=''>Edward L. Ayers</span> offers a somewhat more useful definition: “Although the phrase sometimes refers to issues surrounding copyright and open access and sometimes to scholarship analyzing the online world, digital scholarship emanating, perhaps, from digital humanities most frequently describes discipline based scholarship produced with digital tools and presented in digital form” (2013:27; see also <span class='person' id=''>Rockwell</span> 2011:153). <span class='person' id=''>Ayers</span> cuts to the chase: digital scholarship, as the term is typically used, is scholarship done digitally. (He also usefully underscores the often overlooked point that scholarship and humanities are different words indicating different things.) But, as is always the case, things are more complicated than they appear. It should be acknowledged, for instance, that there is some doubt as to whether digital is actually a necessary descriptor. As <span class='person' id=''>Clifford Lynch</span>, executive director of the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI), writes, “Digital scholarship is an incredibly awkward term that people have come up with to describe a complex group of developments. The phrase is really, at some basic level, nonsensical. After all, scholarship is scholarship. Doing science is doing science. We don’t find the Department of Digital Physics arguing with the Department of Non-Digital Physics about who’s doing ‘real’ physics” (<span class='person' id=''>Lynch</span> 2014:11). <span class='person' id=''>Lynch</span>’s point is well taken. Further, if scholars all use digital tools, then all scholarship is digital, and so the distinction is meaningless (<span class='person' id=''>Martin</span> 2016:3). And new technologies are constantly emerging and have been adopted by scholars throughout history without lending their names to the scholarly enterprise. <span class='person' id=''>Pearce</span> et al. make a related argument: “Digital scholarship can only have meaning if it marks a radical break in scholarship practices brought about through the possibilities enabled in new technologies. This break would encompass a more open form of scholarship” (<span class='person' id=''>Pearce</span> et al. 2010).2 DS only matters, in other words, if it is somehow distinct from, or a clearly delineated subcategory of, scholarship more generally. (We diverge slightly from <span class='person' id=''>Pearce</span> and colleagues in suggesting that the “break” implied by DS need not be a radical one.) As touched on above, a further point of confusion arises from the dual significances of the “digital” in DS itself. The first emphasizes “the digital” as part of the practice of scholarship: bringing digital tools and approaches to bear on scholarly questions, and generating digital forms of output, regardless of the subject of inquiry. These digital approaches might include computer driven textual analysis, databases, web based or multimedia presentations, or complex image analysis. The second emphasizes “the digital” as the object of scholarly inquiry itself (which includes studies of cultures of the digital, or the digital in culture). Sociological analysis of online gamers, the history of “humanities computing” (as digital humanities was previously known—see <span class='person' id=''>Vanhoutte</span> 2013), and rhetorical practices in computer coding are all examples of scholarship focusing on digital technologies, environments, cultures, and cultural practices. Perhaps it is useful to term these “digitally enabled scholarship” and “scholarship of the digital,” respectively. Of course, to add to the confusion, the former might be brought to bear on the latter in what might be (awkwardly) termed “digitally enabled scholarship of the digital.” It may well be that digital scholarship and related terms including digital folkloristics—are simply “terms of transition,” as <span class='person' id=''>Johnson</span> recently suggested in a conference panel (2017), existing only while given disciplines differentially support scholars who rely on digital tools and digital forms and those who choose not to. But at present the digital qualifier remains an important one, invoked in specific contexts toward specific ends, forming the basis for the creation of new programs and centers, courses like <span class='person' id=''>Tolbert</span>’s recent “Digital Tools in the Humanities” at Penn State Harrisburg, and funding opportunities offered by such bodies as the National Endowment for the Humanities through their Office of Digital Humanities (“Digital Humanities Advancement Grants” n.d.) While the usefulness of the term may fade, it presents an opportunity for folkloristic intervention in important extradisciplinary conversations. Two broad categories of digital scholarship inform the present paper. These interdisciplinary methodologies—digital humanities and digital ethnography—interestingly enough reflect a longstanding division within disciplinary folkloristics: the study of folklore as discrete texts, versus an ethnographic approach based in situated fieldwork among contemporary people.3 In contemporary work, the tools and methods folklorists employ generally tend toward the (digital) humanistic, focusing on collecting and analyzing texts, or toward the (digital) ethnographic, focusing on descriptions of cultural processes and performances. In the following sections we briefly describe these strands of digital scholarship as they exist outside of folkloristics, and discuss a few representative examples of each. We stop short of offering comprehensive bibliographies, and in describing these digital areas, we do not offer rigid definitions: rather, we attempt to indicate, broadly, some ways in which these terms are currently invoked before moving to a discussion of existing folkloristic work that aligns with each area.

    <h3>DIGITAL HUMANITIES</h3>
    <!-- <p> -->         Despite the prevalence of digital approaches in fields other than the humanities, digital humanities (or DH) tends to dominate discussions of DS. In fact, within DH itself, the terms digital humanities and digital scholarship are often used interchangeably (e.g., <span class='person' id=''>Courant</span> et al. 2006; <span class='person' id=''>Anderson</span> and <span class='person' id=''>McPherson</span> 2011; <span class='person' id=''>Rockwell</span> 2011; <span class='person' id=''>Ayers</span> 2013). But it is important here to note that DH does not necessarily encompass all humanistic work that has a digital component. DH has a history of its own (on which, see <span class='person' id=''>Vanhoutte</span> 2013), its own methodologies and theoretical orientations (though these are also diverse and interdisciplinary). A humanistic project that makes use of computers or otherwise deals with “the digital” may or may not cleave to DH specific orientations and methodologies. Much ethnographically inflected work, humanistic in nature but focused on/in digital technologies and cultures, does not fall within the current rubric of DH (though there is no reason why it should not). Digital humanities is often seen as a transdisciplinary amalgamation of computermediated approaches to the study of texts. DH is viewed not as a singular field of study, but as “a big tent for all digital scholarship in the humanities” (<span class='person' id=''>Vanhoutte</span> 2013:144; see also <span class='person' id=''>Friedlander</span> 2009:5; <span class='person' id=''>McGann</span> 2011:194 note 8). Defining DH, in common with most disciplines, is difficult, as <span class='person' id=''>Nyhan</span>, <span class='person' id=''>Terras</span>, and <span class='person' id=''>Vanhoutte</span> point out in their introduction to an edited volume on the topic (2013). That volume also includes a list of definitions of the field from DH practitioners which illustrate the huge range of meanings attached to it (<span class='person' id=''>Terras</span>, <span class='person' id=''>Nyhan</span>, and <span class='person' id=''>Vanhoutte</span> 2013). Nevertheless, some key features emerge from the literature: DH approaches often emphasize texts (in both the narrow sense of the written word and the larger sense of bounded objects, such as paintings or songs), textual analyses, and text encoding; digital archiving; data visualization; open research and publication practices; and the construction of new digital tools to accomplish these and related ends. In more general terms, DH frequently involves— and has some of its deepest roots in—the rendering of information from literary and other expressive sources into quantifiable data, which is then used for description, comparison, and analysis, and often shared with the larger community of scholars and audiences outside academia. DH emphasizes the digital, in other words, as part of the process of doing scholarly work. Examples of well established digital humanities projects that highlight collections of materials to ease the path of scholarship include the “Valley of the Shadow” project (<span class='person' id=''>Ayers</span> et al. n.d.), 4 a seminal effort by the University of Virginia historian to create an archive of letters, diaries, newspapers, church and census records, and other materials that permit in-depth comparison of a northern and a southern community (Franklin County, PA, and Augusta County, VA, respectively) in the years surrounding the Civil War and Reconstruction. The text intensive Perseus Digital Library at Tufts University (Crane n.d.) has since the 1980s made primary and secondary materials about the Greco-Roman world, 19th-century America, the Renaissance, and other periods and places available to scholars, along with apparatuses to support automated analysis and connection-building. “The Old Bailey Proceedings Online, 1674-1913” (<span class='person' id=''>Hitchcock</span> et al. 2018) offers “[a] fully searchable edition of the largest body of texts [with accompanying images] detailing the lives of non-elite people ever published, containing 197,745 criminal trials held at London’s central trial court” along with an API that permits datamining and other related textual analysis. The “Women Writers Project,” now housed at Northeastern University (Women Writers Project, Northeastern University 1999-2019), is another longterm project that dates from the 1980s, focused on collecting and sharing texts by pre-Victorian women and supporting a range of text encoding projects. Bodies of literary and visual documents and the apparatuses that support them are, however, only one kind of digital humanities project. Other DH efforts employ approaches that are less traditionally humanistic and may be more appropriately described as being exemplars of digital scholarship writ large. “Mapping the Republic of Letters” (“Mapping the Republic of Letters” n.d.) at Stanford University emphasizes network analysis and other visualizations to illuminate the social and epistolary connections among scholars in the eighteenth century. The Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia partnered with classicist <span class='person' id=''>Jenny Strauss Clay</span> to produce a geospatial analysis of the Catalogue of Ships from Book Two of the Iliad. The resultant project, “Mapping the Catalogue of Ships” (<span class='person' id=''>Clay</span>, <span class='person' id=''>Evans</span>, and <span class='person' id=''>Jasnow</span> n.d.), revealed a “spatial mnemonic” based in actual geography that assisted the poet <span class='person' id=''>Homer</span> in his epic feat of poetic memorization. Tool building is represented by projects such as Omeka (omeka.org) and Neatline (neatline.org); the former is an open-source publishing platform for media rich online exhibits developed at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University and the latter—also a project of the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia—extends Omeka by making it easy to display digital collections on timelines and maps. DH/DS projects need not take long to develop: the “Torn Apart/Separados” project was rapidly developed at four sites over a six-day period in 2018 to aggregate and cross-reference “publicly available data to visualize the geography of <span class='person' id=''>Donald Trump’s</span> ‘zero tolerance’ immigration policy in 2018 and immigration incarceration in the USA in general” (<span class='person' id=''>Ahmed</span> et al. 2018). A large number of “spontaneous event collections” have been created in an effort to collect a body of web content—articles, images, recordings, social media posts, and more—during times of crisis such as the April 2007 Virginia Tech shooting or the protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline. A number of such projects and the tools for managing them have been created by the Archive-It team of the Internet Archive and are available for study (archive-it.org/blog/projects/ spontaneous-events/).

    <h3>DIGITAL ETNOGRAPHY</h3>
    <!-- <p> -->
        Ethnography, a set of methods for the study of culture (usually through situated research involving participant observation), is a hallmark of much contemporary folkloristic work in the United States. Ethnography can easily be understood to include digital cultures/cultures of the digital; but the proliferation of digital technologies and the surprising ways in which humans engage with them has led to different orientations toward the digital and different understandings of its ethnographic implications. Digital ethnography has been called “a method for representing real-life cultures through combining the characteristic features of digital media with the elements of story” (<span class='person' id=''>Underberg</span> and <span class='person' id=''>Zorn</span> 2013:10). This view is less common in the literature, however, which tends instead to view digital ethnography as ethnographic study of digital cultures. In line with this view it has elsewhere been called “ethnographic research on online practices and communications” (Varis 2016:55).5 Broader still is the framework put forth by <span class='person' id=''>Sarah Pink</span> et al., who view digital ethnography as the study of everyday engagement with digital technologies (which includes online or “virtual” ethnography), but one which downplays the digital itself—the proper focus of ethnography being, after all, social processes and human relationships (2016:7, 9–11). A great deal of effort has been dedicated to exploring virtual worlds, such as online video games; two useful critical reviews (both by anthropologists) that situate ethnographies of virtual or digital worlds within the broader ethnographic literature are <span class='person' id=''>Manning</span> (2009) and <span class='person' id=''>Nardi</span> (2015).6 In general, then, where DH emphasizes the use of digital tools to aid scholarly work, digital ethnography tends to emphasize the digital as the object or site of study of study, be it the study of human use of digital technologies, or cultural processes occurring wholly or partly within digital environments. <span class='person' id=''>Ducheneaut</span> et al. (2007) offer an example of an ethnography of a virtual world focused primarily on issues of design. In their study of a massively multiplayer online video game, the authors consider social spaces in different in-game cities, evaluating their relative success or failure as sites of meaningful player socialization. In their conclusion the authors speak directly to the creators of such worlds: “Game designers should consider ways of supporting player-hosted events in a game world’s major cities. Not only will proximity to transportation hubs, banks and markets help would be third places attract more people, but the creative socializing of players will make the major cities much more interesting places than they currently are” (157). In a very different kind of study, <span class='person' id=''>Manning</span> (2013) argues that “alts”—alternate player characters controlled by a single individual within a given game world—“as a third term in addition to the player and the main character, disrupt and complicate the ontological categories of online worlds, categories like identity, humanity and agency” (2). In the end, <span class='person' id=''>Manning</span> claims, the “pathology” of alts destabilizes the ostensibly clear cut relationship between in-game avatars and the offline humans supposedly controlling them. An especially important work in this area is Ethnography and Virtual Worlds: A Handbook of Method (2012), by <span class='person' id=''>Tom Boellstorff</span>, <span class='person' id=''>Bonnie Nardi</span>, <span class='person' id=''>Celia Pearce</span>, and <span class='person' id=''>T.L. Taylor</span>. True to its title, the book provides a useful set of guidelines for working in such “virtual” spaces as online video games. Notably, the authors are uncomfortable with terms like digital ethnography “because ethnographic methodology translates elegantly and fluidly to virtual worlds.” They continue, “While the specificities of these spaces prompt their own set of considerations, the ethnographic research paradigm does not undergo fundamental transformation or distortion in its journey to virtual arenas because ethnographic approaches are always modified for each fieldsite, and in real time as the research progresses” (4). Accepting that ethnography is, in the end, ethnography, we suggest that, as a term of transition, “digital ethnography,” understood as ethnographic work centrally concerned with digital technologies and/or cultures of the digital, remains useful in the present. It cues our attention to explicit differences (of topic, of fieldsite) from earlier written ethnographies, differences which may be important for reasons of funding, course design, and points of contact with other scholarly areas that likewise invoke the digital qualifier. 7 An example of a digital ethnography which moves away from a focus on culture within digital environments and toward the broader role of digital technologies in (offline) vernacular experience is <span class='person' id=''>Jenna Burrell’s</span> essay, “The Fieldsite as a Network: A Strategy for Locating Ethnographic Research” (2017). <span class='person' id=''>Burrell</span> usefully traces changing attitudes toward ethnographic fieldwork, beginning with the classical model of the bounded, physical fieldsite, and moving through <span class='person' id=''>Marcus</span>’s (1995) seminal concept of multi-sited ethnography. Applying <span class='person' id=''>Marcus</span>’s framework to her work on internet cafés in Ghana, <span class='person' id=''>Burrell</span> engages with people’s use of digital technologies from a largely offline perspective. At first <span class='person' id=''>Burrell</span>’s study, aimed at “understanding how the Internet was described and spoken about among users” (54), failed to produce the insights she had hoped for: users of the cafés did not interact with one another in the ways she had anticipated. Reconceiving of her fieldsite as a point embedded in a larger network (which also included other aspects of informants’ day-to-day experiences as well as the distant people with whom they communicated in the cafés), <span class='person' id=''>Burrell</span> was able to construct a more holistic, emically validated understanding of the interrelatedness of the site to other sites, actors, and processes. “By defining the fieldsite as a network … the fieldsite transitions from a bounded space that the researcher dwells within to something that more closely tracks the social phenomenon under study” (58)

    <h3>FOLKLORISTIC APPROACHES TO THE DIGITAL</h3>
    <!-- <p> -->
        Relatively few folklorists have published work that draws explicitly on the digital quantitative methods that characterize DH, though there are some notable exceptions. <span class='person' id=''>Abello</span>, <span class='person' id=''>Broadwell</span> and <span class='person' id=''>Tangherlini</span>’s “computational folkloristics” (2012) is very much a DH approach, centered on tool-building and text analysis. The computational approach <span class='person' id=''>Peter M. Broadwell</span> and <span class='person' id=''>Tangherlini</span> dopt for analyzing Danish legends (2016) depends in large part on the literary strategy called distant reading, which, according to its coiner <span class='person' id=''>Franco Moretti</span>, refocuses attention away from texts themselves to “units that are much larger or smaller than the text: devices, themes, tropes—or genres and systems” (<span class='person' id=''>Moretti</span> 2000:57). <span class='person' id=''>Moretti</span>’s zoomed-out approach relies on the acceptance of “law[s] of literary evolution” (58, original emphasis) which can be assumed to operate everywhere.8 The articles in the 2016 special issue of the Journal of American Folklore entitled “Big Folklore” (Tangherlini 2016), in which <span class='person' id=''>Broadwell</span> and <span class='person' id=''>Tangherlini</span>’s piece appeared, focus on similar quantitative, software-assisted approaches to the analysis of folklore texts. For example, in their article, “Automatic Enrichment and Classification of Folktales in the Dutch Folktale Database,” <span class='person' id=''>Meder</span> and colleagues (2016) discuss the use of machine learning in generating metadata about folk narratives, explicitly situating this work in the context of DH (82). Computational folkloristics, then, in common with extradisciplinary DH work, focuses on the use of computers in the classification and analysis of texts. A similar textual emphasis (manifested in a concern with collecting and archiving texts) is reflected in the call for papers for the 2016 Towards Digital Folkloristics conference, held in Latvia: <span class="quote">During the last few decades, the use of information technology has become an inherent aspect of everyday life; the discipline of folkloristics faces an interdisciplinary “digital turn” and the extension of the folkloristic “field” into the realm of virtual reality. In folklore archives and other cultural heritage institutions, the engagement with IT has evolved far beyond the simple creation of digital copies and cataloguing. The expansion of digitally mediated environments, tools and methods for folklore collecting, processing and research as well as for communicating with the “folk” promises to change the archival world by becoming a sustainable axis for folklore research. The presence of information technology has been persistent enough in the daily agendas of tradition archives andfolkloristic research to launch a reflexive discussion aboutthe disciplinary outcomes, challenges and perspectives of“the digital age.” (“Towards Digital Folkloristics: ResearchPerspectives, Archival Praxis, Ethical Challenges” n.d.)</span> In the framework alluded to here, digital folkloristics implies an IT-supported infrastructure of digitization and archiving. Without question, digital archives are a crucial way of enhancing preservation capacities and extending access to collections. The goals of the CFP also align with the American Council of Learned Societies study cited above, with its focus on digital tools and databases. An important contemporary example of this mode of digital scholarship in the United States is the National Folklore Archives Initiative (NFAI), a project of the American Folklore society, which seeks to provide information about widely dispersed folklore collections and, eventually, digital access to their contents (“National Folklore Archives Initiative—American Folklore Society” n.d.). But contemporary folklore study involves both textual and ethnographic approaches. Despite the Latvia conference’s broad claim to represent a new kind of folkloristics—meaning the discipline as a whole—the words ethnography/ethnographic appear nowhere in the call for papers and in just three of the thirty-seven abstracts (one instance of which is in the name of a sponsoring archive). It is surely true that ethnography generates texts, and that these texts must live somewhere (such as a database). But a digital folkloristics which largely excludes ethnographic methodology seems problematic. Far more folkloristic work has centered on digital cultures. Notably, much of this work is also characterized by a broadly textual/object-oriented focus. As <span class='person' id=''>Anthony Bak Buccitelli</span> notes, “In keeping with the difficulties of locating performer and audience identities in the same way that might be done in offline performative settings, the study of digital folklore has often forsaken performance-oriented approaches for textual studies that can be more easily conducted without direct knowledge of performer identities” (2012:62). A more mechanical reason also exists for the prevalence of textual studies of digital cultures: since so much of what we think of as “the Internet” is textual, often in the sense of literal written text (see <span class='person' id=''>Beaulieu</span> 2004:154–56; 158–59; <span class='person' id=''>Boellstorff</span> et al. 2012:191)—and more generally in the broader sense of bounded, discrete “objects” available to study—it is tempting to focus on the content of digital expressive culture and the movement of digital artifacts through communicative media. But as <span class='person' id=''>Boellstorff</span> et al. note, “When ethnographers study forums and wikis, it is in the context of participant observation research. In other words, while humanities scholars study texts in and of themselves, ethnographers study texts as they link up to people in a community or activity. Texts may be part of that study, but in the case of virtual world ethnography, texts alone are not sufficient” (2012:119). 9 <span class='person' id=''>Robert Glenn Howard</span> likewise reminds us that scholars should direct their attention to the “interpretive communities” that form around online texts, rather than focusing on the texts alone (2008a:194). But even works that do focus on digital “texts” tend in practice to involve both textual and ethnographic components (in the simplest sense of concerted efforts to describe a digital “culture,” often through participant observation). In his introduction to Folklore and the Internet, for example, <span class='person' id=''>Trevor J. Blank</span> suggests that the Internet serves as “a folkloric conduit” (2009:7). <span class='person' id=''>Blank</span>’s explicit focus is on online texts such as chain emails, which, he argues, facilitate the study of “the role of conduits in narrative transference” (9). But of course, as products of human actors, these texts are caught up in complex social networks and processes, which <span class='person' id=''>Blank</span> acknowledges, noting the presence of folk groups online, the human agents behind Internet traditions, and the emergent quality of those traditions (9-12). Other folkloristic work on digital cultures that contains both textual and ethnographic components (by no means an exhaustive list) include <span class='person' id=''>Robert Glenn Howard’s</span> explorations of the “vernacular web” (2005, 2008a, 2008b, 2009a, 2009b, 2015); <span class='person' id=''>Michael Kinsella’s</span> (2011) study of legend-tripping on the Internet; <span class='person' id=''>Bill Ellis’</span> (2012) research on an online community of animation cell collectors; <span class='person' id=''>Montana Miller’s</span> (2012) exploration of the ethics of digital fieldwork; <span class='person' id=''>Buccitelli</span>’s examination of performativity among right-wing discussion forums users (2012), his discussion of Bostonian practices linking on-and offline spatialities (2013), and several contributors’ chapters from his edited volume Race and Ethnicity in Digital Culture (for example, <span class='person' id=''>Buccitelli</span> 2018; <span class='person' id=''>Tolgensbakk</span> 2018; <span class='person' id=''>Li</span> 2018; and, in a somewhat different register, <span class='person' id=''>Lawrence</span> 2018); <span class='person' id=''>Whitney Phillips’</span> study of Internet trolling (2015); and the recent collection of essays on Slender Man, which focuses on emergent practices and cultures among online communities as well as on the corpus of texts they collaboratively produce (<span class='person' id=''>Blank</span> and McNeill 2018), including two chapters by <span class='person' id=''>Tolbert</span> (2018a; 2018b).10 These and other folkloristic works, which examine expressive cultural processes circulating around and communicated through digital technologies, surely deserve inclusion in the category of digital folkloristics. But comparatively few folklorists have engaged explicitly and in a sustained manner with either of the broader methodologies of DH or digital ethnography. None, to our knowledge, have done both in the course of a single project. Taking text-oriented and quantitative approaches on the one hand, and situated ethnographic approaches on the other, we suggest that digital folkloristics can and should occupy the fruitful intersection of both orientations, illuminating not only the texts and processes into and by which digital cultures are organized and mediated, but the social networks (in both the sociological and Internet-mediated senses of that term) and individual human actors who create and mobilize them.

    <h3>DIGITAL FOLKLORISTICS, HOLISTICALLY</h3>
    <!-- <p> -->
        The possibilities for uniting textual and quantitative approaches with ethnographic ones, always rich and often unrealized extend into—indeed, are extended by—the advent of digital tools. In their handbook for ethnography in virtual worlds, <span class='person' id=''>Boellstorff</span> et al. acknowledge this explicitly: “We recognize the potential for collaboration between quantitative and qualitative researchers to bring about research breakthroughs. Quantitative data can tell us about widespread trends…. Participant observation and interview data make quantitative data more useful by making it more meaningful” (2012:127–28). Not every study need utilize both quantitative/digital tools and engage in ethnographic fieldwork of digital cultures, but acknowledging the potential links between these disparate approaches—and seeking opportunities for combining them when doing so may yield greater insights—should be part and parcel of digital folkloristics, precisely as ethnographic and textual approaches are understood together to make up contemporary folkloristics as a whole. Take, for example, a research project that considers both onand offline discursive practices associated with the so-called alt-right. This hypothetical study has plenty of models to draw on: textual/quantitative approaches, on one hand, and ethnographic/qualitative on the other, have already been brought to bear on related topics. On the quantitative side, <span class='person' id=''>Sean M. Eddington</span> (2018) discusses the use of specialized computer software to elucidate connections between the 2016 <span class='person' id=''>Trump</span> presidential campaign and hate groups, based on the use of Twitter hashtags.11 <span class='person' id=''>Eddington</span> uses an app called Twitter Archiver to collect tweets using specific hashtags, such as #MAGA and #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, ultimately analyzing nearly 8,000 tweets from a single day in November 2016. Using a text-mining program called AutoMap, <span class='person' id=''>Eddington</span> discovers a link between the <span class='person' id=''>Trump</span> hashtags and extremist and white supremacist content (4-6). <span class='person' id=''>Eddington</span> finds, “First, theoretically, #MAGA created an organizational space to engage in a global White supremacist discourse…. Second, the use of #MAGA as a space for engagement lends itself to the types of content shared: subtle and overt” (8-9). An ethnographic approach to a closely related topic is offered by anthropologists <span class='person' id=''>Yarimar Bonilla</span> and <span class='person' id=''>Jonathan Rosa</span> (2015), who argue convincingly for the treatment of hashtags as ethnographic fieldsites. <span class='person' id=''>Bonilla</span> and <span class='person' id=''>Rosa</span> suggest that #Ferguson not only served as a way to convey information about an important current event, but a way of drawing media attention, eventually becoming a form of online activism, and spawning related hashtags centered on racially motivated police violence. And folklorist <span class='person' id=''>Sheila Bock</span> (2017) studied the use of hashtags surrounding celebrity chef <span class='person' id=''>Paula Deen</span>. <span class='person' id=''>Bock</span> argues that Black Twitter’s use of hashtags parallels the established tradition of “signifyin(g),” criticizing not only the chef but wider patterns of entrenched racism through the invention of food names which reference racist stereotypes and historical events such as lynchings. Still another ethnographic example is offered by <span class='person' id=''>Pohjonen</span> and <span class='person' id=''>Udupa</span> (2017), who examine specific forms of online rhetoric branded by officials as hate speech in India and Ethiopia. To understand what they term “extreme speech,” <span class='person' id=''>Pohjonen</span> and <span class='person' id=''>Udupa</span> call for “a thorough ethnographic exploration to grasp how different situational features, including technology, online agency, and political cultures, can lead to various kinds of speech—harmless in some contexts, but with serious political ramifications in others” (1176). The authors describe workshops they held in Ethiopia to understand political discourse in online spaces and formulate a more appropriate definition of hate speech consistent with the emic usage of people who engaged in politicized speech online. They conclude that sweeping categorizations of online speech actually play into existing structures of power, and that an ethnographic approach which privileges emic knowledge and practice may act as a corrective (1183-1186). 12 Of the studies just cited that engage with politicized speech online, one is quantitative and computer-driven, while the others are ethnographic. The ethnographic studies in turn differ from one another in that the hashtag studies looked primarily at online speech in online contexts, while the study of politicized speech in India and Ethiopia discussed online speech patterns with participants in offl ine workshops. The four projects represent diverse approaches to the digital, both as an object or context of, and a tool for, study, but the parallels are immediately apparent: all focus on digital discursive practices among real people who use social media; three of the four looked exclusively at hashtags, which have emerged as a significant organizing force and rhetorical tool in contemporary social and political life; implicitly or explicitly, all point to ways in which digital discursive practices may relate to extra-digital attitudes and behaviors; and all, unquestionably, yield insights amenable to contemporary folkloristics. They all also lend support to <span class='person' id=''>Buccitelli</span>’s claim that “folklorists must stop thinking of digital technologies as simply media that record or transmit offline folklore. Instead, we must think of them as places of performance” (2012:73, original emphasis). Digital folkloristics, as we envision it, could encompass both quantitative/computer-assisted and qualitative/ethnographic approaches, and could also offer a space for them to combine in novel ways, guided by folkloristics’ long familiarity with tracing the spread of texts through time and space and by its sensitivity to the social and historical contexts and processes in which expressive culture emerges. Returning to our hypothetical research on alt-right discursive practices, and building on the examples just considered, such a study might begin by generating a collection of thousands of examples of alt-right memes and hashtags before undertaking a large-scale, computer-assisted, textual/historical analysis of these textual artifacts. It could then move to both online and in-person ethnographic fieldwork, in order to understand the use of these discursive tools, as well as how online practices relate to the offline lives of these users. The researcher, through both quantitative and qualitative means, might attempt to identify the social networks through which the hashtags and memes circulate and the public figures around whom they coalesce, mining data and identifying links with software designed for these purposes. Ethnographic work could identify individuals’ locations with the larger trends and networks illuminated by quantitative analysis. This would help in understanding the people who use these hashtags and memes, how they see the ideals represented by these forms of expressive culture in relation to their daily lives, and how their media use and engagements with these discourses position them vis-à-vis other individuals and groups. Familiar folkloristic concerns would be readily apparent through all of this: the establishment and policing of group boundaries and associated emic/etic knowledges and performances; performative competence; tradition and variation; vernacular belief. Quantitative tools can generate a huge usable pile of data—in this case, in the form of memes and archived Tweets—and illustrate its dissemination throughout the social networks being observed (literally, as quantitative tools are especially well suited to data visualization). Ethnographic research can get to the people who generate and use these digital artifacts, and work toward an understanding of their daily lives that isolated data alone cannot. A digital folkloristics that accounts for the field’s various methodologies and for related developments in other disciplines is entirely within reach. Scholars working with large collections of archived materials will benefit from the textualquantitative approaches that have characterized DH scholarship (the “computational folkloristics” expounded by <span class='person' id=''>Abello</span> et al.). This might include collections such as those documented in the American Folklore Society’s Folklore Collections Database, part of the NFAI cited above, which serves as “an open-access online resource providing searchable information about folklore archival collections” held at various institutions around the US (“AFS Folklore Collection Database” n.d.). Such collections may be originally “offline” (e.g., digitizations of folk songs) or “born-digital” (e.g., meme databases), or a combination thereof. Other scholars interested in the cultures of online/virtual communities/spaces or of new/emerging media may find in digital ethnography fertile methodological ground. And combining DH, digital ethnography, and folkloristics’ own unique disciplinary orientations can lead to still richer insights. A similar call is made by <span class='person' id=''>Mike Fortun</span>, <span class='person' id=''>Kim Fortun</span>, and <span class='person' id=''>George E. Marcus</span> (2017) in the first chapter of Routledge’s recent Companion to Digital Ethnography, in which the authors argue for (and describe one attempt at) a digital humanities approach to anthropological research. They discuss PECE, the Platform for Experimental Collaborative Ethnography (worldpece.org), and the possibilities of an open, iterative, interdisciplinary, digitally-enabled anthropology. We face a moment, <span class='person' id=''>Fortun</span> et al. claim, “when anthropologists have ample tools and ample spaces in which to work and play with them, toward multiple theoretical and practical ends… they have ample opportunity and need to do so…within new forms of collaboration” (2017:11). So too, we suggest, with folkloristics, a field equally well-positioned to take advantage of the collaborative opportunities of digital tools and approaches, which already reflect the various orientations and concerns of folklore scholarship. We would be well advised to look beyond folklore’s borders as we enter more fully into the digital. This means not only engaging with scholars in allied fields, but also presenting work on topics of broad interest in ways accessible to the broadest possible audiences. As <span class='person' id=''>Boellstorff</span> and colleagues note, the interdisciplinary nature of “virtual worlds research” can lead to problems of understanding. Avoiding jargon and actively reaching beyond the walls of our disciplines is critical in such work (<span class='person' id=''>Boellstorff</span> et al. 2012:194). This claim is easily extended to all of the digitally-enabled and digitally-focused work we have considered here. Digital approaches can help us to actively engage with colleagues in other disciplines and remind us of—and allow meaningful interactions between—the diversity of methods
        and concerns within our own field.

This is an important point raised by many scholars working in DH: assigning proper credit for works involving many people with diverse skills who make diverse contributions. Our attempt at a citational compromise here should not be taken as devaluing the contributions of project staff whose names are left out; rather it speaks to the limitations of conventional publication and the constraints of conventional scholarship.</li>

On the other hand, the dividing of texts into constituent parts, and the fitting of texts into analytical genres, naturally resonates with literary and historic-geographic approaches to folklore study. For an overview of the historic-geographic method—and an attempt at defending it which itself embodies many of the method’s most problematic assumptions—see <span class='person' id=''>Goldberg</span> 1984. <span class='person' id=''>Goldberg</span> outlines what she sees as the strengths of the method: “It schematizes a lot of information, collating dozens or hundreds of tales, each with, say, five to thirty motifs, so that the reader can remember the main characteristics of the tale and its subtypes and can refer back to the study to find out about minor points” (5).

We take a somewhat broader view of the possibilities of ethnographic study, in keeping with its core meaning—the description of culture, with no specific time limit attached—but accept that participant observation, in the pedestrian sense of interacting with real people on their own terms, is key.</li>
